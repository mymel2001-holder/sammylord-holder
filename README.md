# Hi there, I'm Sammy! 👋

## I'm the anti-GNU, maybe, but in the way that counts

* I'm vibe coding my own tools
* I'm owning my ecosystem
* I'm making sure it serves me, not just ideology

And really, that's the most UNIX thing I can do.

🛠️ Linus: “Make it work, make it scale”
💼 Me: “Make it mine, and maybe make a buck too”
